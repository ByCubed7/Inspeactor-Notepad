~ ~ Thanks for using the editor! ~ ~

I built this just to allow easier note-taking within the Unity Editor itself, without having to go through the 5 stages of grief to open a 3rd party text editor *just* to type a few sentences down--

Feel free to use, suggest, edit, branch etc! I appreciate credit however it's not required. 

This was inspired originally by KaiClavier's NotePad! Made back in 2016. Go give 'em a look!

Anyway... I should stop procrastinating with making a note editor and actually do some work ;-;

Cheers,
